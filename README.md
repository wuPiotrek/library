## üîß Architecture and Design

This application follows a modular design, with key components organized into packages:

1. **Application Layer** (`pl.javastart.library.app`):
   - Main entry point (`LibraryApp.java`) and application control logic.

2. **Model Layer** (`pl.javastart.library.model`):
   - Core entities like `Book`, `Magazine`, `LibraryUser`, and `Publication`.
   - Implements interfaces such as `CsvConvertible` for easy data exchange.

3. **I/O Layer** (`pl.javastart.library.io`):
   - Handles user input and output via `ConsolePrinter` and `DataReader`.

4. **Persistence Layer** (`pl.javastart.library.io.file`):
   - Provides file management with `CsvFileManager` and `SerializableFileManager`.

5. **Exception Handling** (`pl.javastart.library.exception`):
   - Custom exceptions like `DataImportException`, `NoSuchFileTypeException`, and `PublicationAlreadyExistsException`.
